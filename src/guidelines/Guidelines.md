# System Guidelines for Garv Pandey’s Portfolio Template

Welcome to **Garv Pandey’s Infinite-Scroll Portfolio Template** 🎨  
This template is designed to help creators and PMs build elegant, storytelling-driven personal portfolios inspired by modern design systems.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
- Focus on **clarity, smooth motion, and storytelling**.  
- Every section should feel like part of a continuous, infinite scroll journey.  
- Maintain **dark-modern aesthetics** with calm gradients and light motion — avoid flashy or harsh effects.  
- The design should reflect **product thinking, design empathy, and technical fluency**.

---

## 🎨 Visual Design Guidelines
- Base background: `#0C0E12`  
- Gradient stops: `#0C0E12 → #141820 → #1A1E26`  
- Accent: `#5DADE2` (muted cyan glow)  
- Typography:  
  - Headings → **Satoshi SemiBold / Inter Bold**  
  - Body → **Inter Regular**
- Spacing rhythm: 24px grid system  
- Glow effects should only appear on background layers, **never on UI elements**.

---

## 🧩 Layout Rules
- Each section occupies **100vh** and connects with gradient blending.  
- “Learning Journey” and “Selected Work” use horizontal scroll activation after two vertical scrolls.  
- Maintain **scroll inertia and ease-out-quart** transitions for natural motion.  
- Projects and experience cards should be **glassmorphic**, with subtle hover elevation.

## 🧰 Content Structure
Follow this section flow:
1️⃣ Hero  
2️⃣ About Me  
3️⃣ Education  
4️⃣ Certificates & Achievements  
5️⃣ Experience  
6️⃣ Projects  
7️⃣ Contact  

Each section’s tone: **calm, confident, and human** — storytelling over stats.

---

## 🪄 Animation Guidelines
- Scroll reveals → opacity 0→1, Y +40→0  
- Cursor glow → background-only, blur 180px, opacity 0.08  
- Background gradients → slow vertical drift (10–15s loop)  
- Button hovers → scale(1.05), soft transition (0.3s ease)

---

## 📦 Export Notes
When exporting:
- Always include responsive mode and animations.  
- Fonts must be embedded.  
- Optimize all image assets (<300KB each).  
- Preferred deployment: **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

---

## 🔮 Behavioral Rules for AI
- When asked to edit, improve, or expand the portfolio, **preserve tone and flow**.  
- Always respect existing visual hierarchy.  
- Never introduce bright, clashing, or neon colors.  
- Maintain smooth, realistic animation speeds — no abrupt transitions.  
- Use descriptive, product-thinking copy (not generic developer text).
